# ML-DL-SideProjects
These projects are meant to demonstrate the pipeline from data processing, cleaning, analysis to modelling for both supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms.

It also includes some of the Deep Learning work such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and stock prediction using CNN and RNN (LSTM).
